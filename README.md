# HTML-Forms Front-End and Back-end Connection Demo
Collection of basic HTML forms I designed. Login Page - Copy is the form I have been working with. In that Databases are also connected and sql file is shared with you guys. It is recommeded to use XAMPP.
1) Login-Page - Copy :- This file contains a baisc HTML Form where Login and Sign Up features are implememted. Databases are used but in seperate php files.
2) Login-Page and Category :- This is more updated form as sign up feature is removed for unknown reasons and Add category form has been added. The database of category is sepeartely created and the concept of config file is implemented in this little folder project.
3) Login-Page :- This is basic login page. This was my first attempt.
4) Login-Page.html :- Basic HTML code of Login Page
5) pathology_data.sql :- This is database file which will be updated after every updation in the code.
6) add-category.html :- One can also refer this file for connection to the database, very similar yet bit diffrent from the Login-Page and Category.html (This is inside the Login-Page and Category folder)
