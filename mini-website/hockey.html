                Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either 
                an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.

                In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, 
                either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 
                Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck") with a 
                hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 
                during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified 
                in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in 
                the newly emerging Special Olympics.
