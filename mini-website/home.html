              <h1>SPORTS</h1>

                <p>A human activity involving physical exertion and skill as the primary focus of the activity, with elements of 
                    competition or social participation where rules and patterns of behaviour governing the activity exist 
                    formally through organisations and is generally recognised as a sport.</p>

                <p>It is an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, 
                    as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc. a particular 
                    form of this, especially in the out of doors.</p>

                <p>Participation in sports is a great way of staying active and offers wonderful rewards for mental health. 
                    Being involved in sports has been proven to help children learn valuable skills for dealing with life's ups 
                    and downs. They teach youth how to interact with others and work as a team. 
                    This skill facilitates working with others in other ways such as on a class project or a school play. 
                    Sports also help students become more independent and feel better about themselves. 
                    The result is positive self-esteem and self-confidence, which are extremely important for determining 
                    later happiness and success.
