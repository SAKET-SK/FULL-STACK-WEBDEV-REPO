            <h1> Cricket </h1>
            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of 
                which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
                The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then 
                running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to 
                prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and 
                dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the 
                stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, 
                but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front 
                of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. 
                The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
                They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

                Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so 
                take the first innings.[69] Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[69] In each innings, one team bats,
                attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and 
                dismiss the batters.[70][71] When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings 
                depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two 
                scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.
